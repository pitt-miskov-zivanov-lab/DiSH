The DiSH2.0 (Discrete, Stochastic, Heterogeneous) modeling and simulation framework combines the advantages of logical and discrete modeling while accommodating varying degrees of information precision. It simulates hybrid models incorporating both logical and algebraic update functions, enabling optimal utilization of qualitative and quantitative information. Unlike previous approaches that used Boolean variables for discrete element values, DiSH2.0 employs discrete variables with any necessary number of levels, simplifying model creation and verification.
